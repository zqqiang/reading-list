 *
 * Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in
 * the board.
 * 
 * Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
 * where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The
 * same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
 * [
 * ⁠ ['o','a','a','n'],
 * ⁠ ['e','t','a','e'],
 * ⁠ ['i','h','k','r'],
 * ⁠ ['i','f','l','v']
 * ]
 * 
 * Output: ["eat","oath"]
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
