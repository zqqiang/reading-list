297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (todo)
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence 
of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and 
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. 
You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

class Codec {
public:

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        
    }

28. Implement strStr()
Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

            int flag = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < ns; j++) {
                if (haystack[i + j] != needle[j]) {
                    flag = 1;
                    break;
                }

46. Permutations
Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
