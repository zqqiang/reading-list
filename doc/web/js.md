## Promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

### States
A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.  
fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.  
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.  

### Demo
[promise.js](../../src/js/promise.js)
