# CS Education Recommend

## Open Source Society University

The [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials.  

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.  

The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.

[Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/)

This guide provides tips and resources to help you develop your technical skills (academically and non-academically) through self-paced, hands-on learning.

This guide is intended for Computer Science students seeking an internship or university grad role at Google.

If you are not from the computer science background, take all the introductory courses mentioned in the first two section. 

This part will take a lot of time. Possibly an year if you are an absolute beginner.

Once you are good with basics of programming you can take the courses mentioned in the second, third and fourth section.

The next section talks about Data Structures and Algorithms. If you are an undergrad of you are looking for a programming job, you should take this section seriously. 

The rest of the sections are really optional (except OS) and depends on your interest.
