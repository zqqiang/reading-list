# Startup vs Big Company

## Difference

### Compensation

Well known company it's going be fixed and when you got stock it's going to be sure what you will got somthing.  
When you go into a startup you don't really know what's value the stocks going to be and often going to be completely nothing for you.
And startup has a bunch of different way like fire you before IPO or they can delay the IPO which make you work longer.  
They can tell you that you can have million shares but really never tell you exactly what percentage you own.  
If you finally leave the company when you quit you have to pay tons of taxes on the stocks.  
If the company never IPO or 10 years before the company IPO you may pay bunch of money on the stocks which end with a big risks.  
Startup eventally get be accquired. Acquisition happens more commonly than IPO then everybody get some payment of their stocks.
It's not really like life changing money.

### Good thing

The challenge are going to be very different.  
Large company you are often work on a large codebase.  
A lots of challenge are going to be orgnization and you are going to deal with a lot of people, cross function of teams.  
And there are going to be tens of code and people blocking everything you are trying to do.  
Startup you are going to get more freedom and anything you want to do you can try that.  
If you don't want to be a programmer like you want to be a product manager or designer.
You can get a management role quiet easily then you can accquire more and more experience.
After a number of years you can transfer to a large tech company.  
The startup maybe a good path for that.

### Learning

If you want to get more experience, learn and build yourself skills, the startup is a good way to do it.  
The worse reason to join a startup because you think you can earn a lots of money and you are going to make rich.  
You hate work and not trying to learn anything.  
Another thing I need to mention here is I don't think money is the proper motivation.
