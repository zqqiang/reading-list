# Capwap Issues

#### why AP <==> AC ssl handshake failed ?
```js
Certificate failed verification. Error: 9 (certificate is not yet valid)
```
by default it should be somewhere around July 2017 when FAP boot up  
if AP time older than July 2017 cert verify will fail  

#### how AP and AC sync their time ?
