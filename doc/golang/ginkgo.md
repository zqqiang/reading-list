BDD Testing Framework for Go http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/

## BDD

BDD means behavior driven development which is an agile software methodology  
BDD encourage collaboration between developers  
In project people use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the app should behave  
BDD is emerged from TDD (Test driven development) and shared ideas such as general techniques and principles  
The different between them are domain driven design and object oriented ananlysis design

## DSL

DSL (Domain Specific Language) using nature language to express the behavior and expected outcome  
BDD is largely facilitated throught the use of DSL

## Principles

1. define a test set for the unit first;
1. make the tests fail;
1. then implement the unit;
1. finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.
