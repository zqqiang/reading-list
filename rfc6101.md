# The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol Version 3.0

## Introduction

* The protocol is composed of two layers.
* SSL record protocol: used for encapsulation of various higher level protocols.
* SSL handshake protocol: allows the server and client to authenticate each other and to negotiate an encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys before the application protocol transmits or receives its first byte of data.

## Cryptographic Attributes
   The four cryptographic operations digital signing, stream cipher
   encryption, block cipher encryption, and public key encryption are
   designated digitally-signed, stream-ciphered, block-ciphered, and
   public-key-encrypted, respectively.

## SSL Protocol

### Session and Connection State
* An SSL session is stateful.
* When the client or server receives a change cipher spec
   message, it copies the pending read state into the current read
   state.
* When the client or server sends a change cipher spec message,
   it copies the pending write state into the current write state.
### Record Payload Protection and the CipherSpec
* Once the handshake is complete, the two parties have shared secrets
   that are used to encrypt records and compute keyed Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) on their contents.

*  The techniques used
   to perform the encryption and MAC operations are defined by the
   CipherSpec and constrained by CipherSpec.cipher_type.
*  The encryption
   and MAC functions translate an SSLCompressed structure into an
   SSLCiphertext.  The decryption functions reverse the process.
   Transmissions also include a sequence number so that missing,
   altered, or extra messages are detectable.

### Handshake Protocol Overview
*  When an SSL client and server first start communicating, they
   agree on a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms,
   optionally authenticate each other, and use public key encryption
   techniques to generate shared secrets.
*  the client sends a client hello message to which the server must respond
   with a server hello message, or else a fatal error will occur and the
   connection will fail.
*  The client hello and server hello are used to
   establish security enhancement capabilities between client and
   server.
*  The client hello and server hello establish the following
   attributes: Protocol Version, Session ID, Cipher Suite, and
   Compression Method.  Additionally, two random values are generated
   and exchanged: ClientHello.random and ServerHello.random.
*  Following the hello messages, the server will send its certificate,
   if it is to be authenticated.
*  Additionally, a server key exchange
   message may be sent, if it is required (e.g., if their server has no
   certificate, or if its certificate is for signing only).
*  If the server is authenticated, it may request a certificate from the
   client, if that is appropriate to the cipher suite selected.
*  Now the server will send the server hello done message, indicating that the
   hello-message phase of the handshake is complete.
*  If the server has sent a certificate request message, the client must send either the
   certificate message or a no_certificate alert.
*  The client key exchange message is now sent, and the content of that message will
   depend on the public key algorithm selected between the client hello
   and the server hello.
*  If the client has sent a certificate with
   signing ability, a digitally-signed certificate verify message is
   sent to explicitly verify the certificate.
*  At this point, a change cipher spec message is sent by the client,
   and the client copies the pending CipherSpec into the current
   CipherSpec.
*  The client then immediately sends the finished message
   under the new algorithms, keys, and secrets.
*  In response, the server
   will send its own change cipher spec message, transfer the pending to
   the current CipherSpec, and send its finished message under the new
   CipherSpec.
*  At this point, the handshake is complete and the client
   and server may begin to exchange application layer data.
#### resume a previous session or duplicate an existing session
* The client sends a ClientHello using the session ID of the session to be resumed.
* If a match is found, and the server is willing to re-establish the
   connection under the specified session state, it will send a
   ServerHello with the same session ID value.
* At this point, both client and server must send change cipher spec messages and proceed
   directly to finished messages.
* If a session ID match is not found, the server generates a new session ID and the SSL client and
   server perform a full handshake.

### Handshake Protocol
#### Hello Request
* The hello request message may be sent by the server at any time, but
   will be ignored by the client if the handshake protocol is already
   underway.
* It is a simple notification that the client should begin
   the negotiation process anew by sending a client hello message when
   convenient.
#### Client Hello
* it is required to send the client hello as its first message.
* The client can also send a client
   hello in response to a hello request or on its own initiative in
   order to renegotiate the security parameters in an existing
   connection.
* The client hello message includes a variable-length session
   identifier.  If not empty, the value identifies a session between the
   same client and server whose security parameters the client wishes to
   reuse.
* The CipherSuite list, passed from the client to the server in the
   client hello message, contains the combinations of cryptographic
   algorithms supported by the client in order of the clientâ€™s
   preference (first choice first).
* The server will select a cipher
   suite or, if no acceptable choices are presented, return a handshake
   failure alert and close the connection.
#### Server Hello
